# Introduction to Next JS

### PHP (Server-side Scripting Language)

- PHP code is executed on the server (SSR)
- The result is returned to the browser as plain HTML
- SEO Friendly Websites
- No User Interactivity

### React JS (JavaScript library used for building user interfaces)

- Create User Interactive Websites
- Uses (CSR) Client-side Rendering
- Poor Performance
- No SEO Friendly Websites

### Next JS (The React Framework for the Web)

- Uses (SSR) Server-side Rendering
- Uses (CSR) Client-side Rendering
- SEO Friendly Websites
- High Performance

# Let’s start our journey with Next JS

### Next JS is like React with Super Power. Super Powers

- **Built in optimizations:** Automatic image, font and script optimizations for improved UX and Core web vitals.
- **Pre-rendering (SSG + SSR):** Created blazingly fast applications because of static site generation and server side rendering.
- **Next Level Data Fetching:** Data Fetching methods that run on the server and enable you to render content in different ways.
- **Powerful Routing and Layouts:** Build complex interfaces and ship less JavaScript. It has a file-system based router built on concepts of pages and can shared nested layouts.
- **React Server Component:** Add components without sending additional client side JavaScript. Built on the latest React features.
- **API Routes:** Build API endpoints to securely connect with third party services and consume from your frontend.

# Why Next JS the competitive edge of Next JS over React JS

### React JS Full-stack Application

- React Router DOM
- Express JS
- Firebase or any Third party Auth

### Next JS Full-stack Application

- Built-in Routing System
- API Routes
- Next Auth

### Performance

Next JS is blazingly fast. Applications created with Next JS are blazingly fast because of pre-rendering.

### What is Rendering?

Rendering a webpage is the process of turning HTML, CSS and JavaScript code into an interactive page that website visitors expect to see.

### Rendering

- Pre-rendering
  - Static Site Generation (SSG)
  - Server Side Rendering (SSR)
